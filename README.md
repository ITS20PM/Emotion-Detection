# Emotion-Detection using machine learning model
## Introduction
This project is used to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of **seven categories**, using the Convolutional Neural Network model. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.
